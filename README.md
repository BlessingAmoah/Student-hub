üì¶ Getting Started

‚ö†Ô∏è You‚Äôll need two separate terminals to run the frontend and backend servers concurrently.

1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:
	‚Ä¢	Node.js (v18 or later)
	‚Ä¢	npm or yarn
	‚Ä¢	Git
	‚Ä¢	PostgreSQL (optional if using Docker)
	‚Ä¢	Docker & Docker Compose (optional but recommended)
	‚Ä¢	AWS S3 bucket (optional, used for file uploads)

2. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/BlessingAmoah/student-hub.git
cd student-hub


3. Install Dependencies

Backend

cd backend
npm install

Frontend

Open a new terminal:

cd frontend
npm install

4. Configure Environment Variables

In the backend directory:
	1.	Copy the example template:

cp .env.template .env

	2.	Fill in the values inside .env:

NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/student_hub
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET=optional_bucket_name
DEMO_MODE=true

.env is already included in .gitignore for security.

For demo mode, set DEMO_MODE=true and use the provided seed data.


5. Set Up the Database (Optional if using Docker)

macOS

brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql

Ubuntu/Debian

sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql

Windows

Download and install from: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

Create the database:

psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE student_hub;


6. Run Database Migrations

cd backend
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate


7. Start the Application

Backend (Terminal 1)

cd backend
node server.js

Frontend (Terminal 2)

cd frontend
npm start


8. Access the Application

Once running, open your browser and go to:
üîó http://localhost:3000

üê≥ Using Docker (Recommended for Quick Start)

docker-compose up --build

This will spin up both the backend and frontend along with a PostgreSQL container pre-configured.

üìÆ Optional Email Setup

If you‚Äôd like to enable email verification or password resets:
	1.	Use any SMTP provider (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid).
	2.	Update the following environment variables:

EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail

EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password

Gmail users: Enable 2FA and create an App Password for authentication.
